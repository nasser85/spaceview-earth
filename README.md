# Nasa App

This app uses the **Google Maps API** in tandem with the **NASA API** to fetch the most recent *LANDSAT 8* image of any location (address, city, state, country, landmark, etc.).  The *LANDSAT 8* satellite takes pictures of the entire earth every 16 days.

For more information check out [Nasa's Api Docs on the Earth Endpoint](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#earth)
